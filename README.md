# PY-CORE-DS
- This is an implementation of a core data structures & algorithms written in Python with Strict typing & Generics, to be used elsewhere for building blocks of other data structures & algorithms.
- To be Packaged as a Python Package.
- Each data structure is unit tested with pytest & type checks done with mypy.
- A major motivation behind this project is [this repository by Omkar Pathak](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/Data-Structures-using-Python)
